# Problem45: Convert Record To Line

## Overview
This C# program demonstrates how to structure and convert client data into a single string line, formatted for easy storage or transfer. It uses a `struct` to define a client's information and provides functionality to:

1. Collect client data.
2. Convert the data into a formatted string with a custom separator.

The program is designed to be simple and modular, making it suitable for scenarios like file storage or data transmission.

## Code Details

### Namespace
The program is encapsulated within the `Problem45` namespace.

### Struct Definition
The `stClientData` struct is used to store client information:
- `accNumber`: Account number (string).
- `pinCode`: PIN code (string).
- `name`: Client's name (string).
- `phone`: Phone number (string).
- `accBalance`: Account balance (double).

### Methods
#### 1. `ReadNewClient()`
- Prompts the user to input client details.
- Returns a populated `stClientData` object.

#### 2. `ConvertRecordToLine(stClientData clientData, string separator = "#//#")`
- Converts the client's record into a single string with fields separated by a specified separator (default: `#//#`).
- Outputs the formatted string.

#### 3. `Main()`
- Reads client data using `ReadNewClient()`.
- Converts the data into a formatted string using `ConvertRecordToLine()`.
- Prints the formatted string to the console.

## How It Works
1. **Collect Input:** The user is prompted to enter the account number, PIN code, name, phone number, and account balance.
2. **Format Data:** The data is converted into a single string with the specified delimiter.
3. **Output:** The formatted string is displayed in the console.

## Example Run
### Input
```
Please enter client Data:

Enter Account Number? 123456
Enter Pin Code? 7890
Enter Name? John Doe
Enter Phone? 555-1234
Enter Account Balance? 1000.50
```

### Output
```

Client Record for saving is:
123456#//#7890#//#John Doe#//#555-1234#//#1000.5
```

## Key Features
- **Customizable Separator:** The `ConvertRecordToLine` method allows specifying a custom delimiter.
- **Struct for Data Management:** Ensures organized and clear data handling.
- **Simple and Modular Design:** Easy to adapt and extend.

## Potential Use Cases
- Saving client data to a file.
- Transferring records over a network.
- Creating backups of structured data.

## Conclusion
This program offers a straightforward approach to formatting and storing structured data in C#. Its modular design and use of a `struct` make it a valuable starting point for more advanced data processing applications.
